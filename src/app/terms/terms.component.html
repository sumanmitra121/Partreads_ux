            <!-- <p></p> -->
           <p class="customIntroduction"> 
            Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Eostre, full payment for participation in a Platform is required at the time of registration. In the case of Platforms that include a trial window, such trial window shall be made available only after the full payment. During the trial window, upon a request by the student, and to the satisfaction of Eostre, Eostre may, in accordance with the applicable refund policy for the particular Platform, choose to refund the Platform Fees paid, subject to deduction of such applicable charges for including but not limiting to administrative and marketing expenses, as may be decided by Eostre from time to time. Once the trial window is closed, there will be no refund allowed for any reason whatsoever. For all the Platform, where there is no trial window or preparatory session, refund shall be done in accordance with the terms and conditions of refund policy of the respective Platform.
            It is the sole responsibility of the user enrolling into a Platform to check the accuracy of, and evaluate the suitability and relevance of, the Platform elected. The enrolment into a Platform is non-transferable.
            To make payment for any Platform or to purchase any services or products offered by Eostre through the Platform, you must have internet access and a current valid accepted payment method as indicated during sign-up ("Payment Method"). Eostre does not store any of your credit card information or such other information restricted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for processing payment and has partnered with payment gateways for the payment towards the services. By using a third-party payment provider, you agree to abide by the terms of such a payment provider. You agree that in case Eostre’s third-party payment provider stores any such information, Eostre will not be responsible for such storage, and it will be solely at your discretion to allow the third party to store such information. Any loss of such information or any loss incurred by you due to the usage of such information will be solely a loss incurred by you, and Eostre is in no way liable for any such losses and is neither responsible to reimburse / make good such losses in any manner whatsoever. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the payments made through the Platform.
            Failure to pay the applicable Platform fee may result in withdrawal of your access to a Platform. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or exchange rates. Eostre does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide to us at the time of enrolment/purchase.
            You may cancel your enrolment at any time. Each Platform has specific refund terms which shall be applicable in case of refund on account of such cancellation requests.
            If you have subscribed for a free trial, the free trial period will last for the period of time specified during your sign-up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers. If you have subscribed to a particular paid service or product within the last six (6) months, or if your Payment Method, physical address, contact number or email address has been associated with an account for that paid service, you are not eligible to receive a free trial for that service or product. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, you may be ineligible for certain features of a product or service during your free trial period.

You acknowledge that any such Platform Certificate awarded may not be affiliated to any Educational Partner and may not stand in the place of a course taken with an Educational Partner or convey academic credit or certification for any Educational Partner.
            You will not receive academic credit from Eostre or any other Educational Partner for taking a Platform. If you are taking a Platform for academic credit or certification as a student of, or otherwise through, an Educational Partner, any such credit or certification may only be awarded directly by the Educational Partner based on its own policies and procedures, and you may be required by that Educational Partner to be registered or enrolled with the Educational Partner in order to receive credit or certification; and, in any event, Eostre will not have any authority or responsibility with respect to any award of academic credit or certification provided by an Educational Partner for a Platform.
            You acknowledge and agree that any Platform affiliated with an Educational Partner may be subject to the terms, policies and procedures of the applicable Educational Partner in addition to Eostre’s Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, if you are a student registered or enrolled at, or are otherwise attending, an Educational Partner and are taking a Platform for credit or certification through that Educational Partner, you acknowledge and agree that (a) the Educational Partner may have its own terms, policies or procedures regarding your eligibility to participate in the Platform, your participation in the Platform, the requirements or prerequisites for receiving credit or certification for the Platform, and/or your educational or student records as they may relate to your participation and performance in the Platform, and (b) your educational or student records are maintained by the Educational Partner, including for purposes of assigning credit or certification, and not Eostre.

If you are under the age of 18 or under the legal age in your jurisdiction to enter into a binding contract, you may use the Platform only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by the Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian agreeing to the Terms for the benefit of a child below 18, be advised that you are fully responsible for his/her use of the Platform, including all financial charges and legal liability that he/she may incur. By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into the Terms and to abide by all of the terms and conditions set forth herein. The Platforms are not for the use of individuals under the age of 18 years.
            Eostre may freely transfer or assign any portion of its rights or delegate its obligations under these Terms or any Platform specific terms. You shall not transfer or assign, by operation of law or otherwise, any portion of your rights or delegate your obligations under these Terms or any Platform-specific terms without the prior written consent of Eostre.
            These Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws in India, as these are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within India and without giving effect to any principles of conflict of laws. You agree that any legal lawsuit or other action brought by Eostre, you or any third party to enforce these Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you, or in connection with any matters related to the Platform or Platforms, shall be subject only to the jurisdiction of the courts of Kolkata. Where a dispute arises, the parties involved shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations. If efforts to amicably resolve any dispute or claim between the parties are unsuccessful, then such dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with the Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1956, as amended (“Act”) before a sole arbitrator to be appointed by Eostre. The proceedings shall be conducted in English and the seat for arbitration shall be Kolkata.
            If any provision of the Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you is found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the other provisions herein, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Eostre shall have no liability under these Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you, to the extent arising from any failure of Eostre to perform any of its obligations under these Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you, due to any fire, flood, earthquakes, other acts of God, war, civil unrest, terrorism, Internet failures, governmental act or court order, national emergency, strikes or labour disputes or any other event not within Eostre 's reasonable control. Eostre shall not be responsible for damage or other problems caused by any unauthorised change to these Terms made by way of hacking or cracking this page.
            The failure of Eostre to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you, shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, to the extent that may lawfully be done, and the other provisions of these Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you, shall remain in full force and effect.
            These Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you constitute the entire agreement between you and Eostre relating to the matters set forth herein, and shall not be modified except in writing, as posted on the Platforms by Eostre or through a specific writing between you and Eostre.
            Eostre may freely transfer or assign any portion of its rights or delegate its obligations under the Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you. You may not transfer or assign, by operation of law or otherwise, any portion of your rights or delegate your obligations under the Terms or any Platform-specific terms shared with you, without the prior written consent of Eostre, and any such attempted transfer or assignment shall be void and of no effect.
