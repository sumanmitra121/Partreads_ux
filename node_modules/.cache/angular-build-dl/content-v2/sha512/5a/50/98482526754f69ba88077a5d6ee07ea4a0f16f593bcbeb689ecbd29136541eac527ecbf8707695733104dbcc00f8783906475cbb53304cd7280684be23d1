Eostre does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide to us at the time of enrolment/purchase.\n            You may cancel your enrolment at any time. Each Platform has specific refund terms which shall be applicable in case of refund on account of such cancellation requests.\n            If you have subscribed for a free trial, the free trial period will last for the period of time specified during your sign-up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers. If you have subscribed to a particular paid service or product within the last six (6) months, or if your Payment Method, physical address, contact number or email address has been associated with an account for that paid service, you are not eligible to receive a free trial for that service or product.
